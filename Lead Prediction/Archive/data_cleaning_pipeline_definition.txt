Global Method: give the file's name - save the file into new file called "file_name + _cleaned". 


A. Purely Column based cleaning 
I. Some column dropping 
- drop useless columns 
  Function takes name of columns to drop
  Checks if columns have more than one type of element, o/w we drop 

II. Feature transformation 
- Feature grouping 
  Some features can be grouped: not the entire info needed (eg. phone number can be grouped into feature: client gave his phone number) 
- One-hot-encoding if needed  

III. Correlation checks ... 
- draw the heatmap 
- Check which feature are highly correlated - drop some 
  (define threshold, delete feature that are passed a thershold them -- attention, not features correlated to the target) 
- or use PCA 

B. Oberservation based selection 
I. Different behaviour to adopt toward null values (what to do with null values ?) 
- propose different options: replace by mean, median, guess the value ... 
  Needs to be feature based, find a way to map column's name to the methods' name selected for outlier 

II. Outliers removal
Select a method (one or many) to delete outliers cov quantiles, power method ... 

III. Further pre-porcessing (normalization, standardization ...) 

Remove outliers ? Which methods to use ? 
 
Normalization
